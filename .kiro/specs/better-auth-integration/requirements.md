# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates Better Auth with Payload Auth to provide a comprehensive role-based authentication system. The integration will enable multiple user roles (SuperAdmin, Admin, Business, HR, Content, User) with proper access controls across the CMS while maintaining compatibility with both authentication systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure Better Auth to work seamlessly with Payload's existing authentication system, so that users can authenticate through either system while maintaining consistent role-based access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Better Auth is configured THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing Payload authentication
2. WHEN a user authenticates through Better Auth THEN their session SHALL be recognized by Payload's access control system
3. WHEN a user authenticates through Payload THEN their session SHALL be recognized by Better Auth middleware
4. IF authentication fails in one system THEN the other system SHALL handle the fallback gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define and manage multiple user roles (SuperAdmin, Admin, Business, HR, Content, User), so that different types of users have appropriate access levels throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL support six distinct roles: SuperAdmin, Admin, Business, HR, Content, and User
2. WHEN a user is created THEN they SHALL be assigned exactly one role from the available options
3. WHEN role definitions are updated THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in both Better Auth and Payload systems
4. IF a user's role is changed THEN their access permissions SHALL update immediately across all systems

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want role-based access controls for collections and media, so that users can only access resources appropriate to their role level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a SuperAdmin accesses any collection THEN they SHALL have full CRUD permissions
2. WHEN an Admin accesses collections THEN they SHALL have read, create, and update permissions but limited delete permissions
3. WHEN HR users access media THEN they SHALL only see PDF files
4. WHEN Content users access media THEN they SHALL only see image files (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG)
5. WHEN Business users access the system THEN they SHALL have read-only access to approved content
6. WHEN regular Users access the system THEN they SHALL have minimal read access to public content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to synchronize user data between Better Auth and Payload, so that user information remains consistent across both authentication systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers through Better Auth THEN their profile SHALL be created in Payload with the appropriate role
2. WHEN a user's profile is updated in Payload THEN the changes SHALL sync to Better Auth
3. WHEN a user's role is modified THEN both systems SHALL reflect the updated permissions
4. IF synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want middleware that validates user roles and permissions, so that API endpoints and admin interfaces are properly secured based on user roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API request is made THEN the middleware SHALL validate the user's authentication status
2. WHEN a user accesses a protected route THEN the system SHALL verify their role has appropriate permissions
3. WHEN role validation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes (401 for unauthenticated, 403 for unauthorized)
4. WHEN JWT tokens are used THEN they SHALL include role information for efficient permission checking

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure session management that works with both authentication systems, so that users have a seamless experience regardless of which system they authenticate through.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in through Better Auth THEN their session SHALL be valid for Payload admin access
2. WHEN a user logs in through Payload THEN their session SHALL be valid for Better Auth protected routes
3. WHEN a session expires THEN both systems SHALL handle the logout gracefully
4. WHEN "remember me" is selected THEN the session SHALL persist according to configured duration limits
